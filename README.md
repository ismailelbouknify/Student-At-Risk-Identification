# Student-At-Risk-Identification
This repository contains the model architecture and the experimental setup of the paper titled 'Student At-Risk Identification and Classification through Multitask Learning: A Case Study on the Moroccan Education System'.


## Overview:
This repository is part of the DEWS Dropout Early Warning System project, a critical component of the larger initiative to address the challenges of dropout rates in the Moroccan education system. Developed as a collaboration between UM6P (Universit√© Mohammed VI Polytechnique) and the Moroccan Ministry of Education, this project harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify students at risk of academic failure or dropout.

At its core, the project aims to build an AI-based system capable of early detection and intervention for students who are struggling academically or at risk of dropping out of school. Using advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques, the system aims to analyze various indicators and patterns to accurately predict potential dropout cases.

The primary goal of the DEWS project is twofold: first, to identify students at risk of failure or dropping out early, and second, to provide timely support and interventions to prevent such outcomes. By harnessing the power of AI, the system aims to provide personalized support and resources tailored to the specific needs of each at-risk student, thereby increasing their chances of academic success and retention.
